+
+This provides a natural language interface to Python's general-purpose capabilities:

+- Run `selenium` to control a Chrome browser.
+- Modify files/folders on your local system.

 - Uses `pip` and `apt-get` to extend itself.
 - Interactive, streaming chat inside your terminal.

+**Open Interpreter** lets GPT-4 run Python code locally. You can chat with Open Interpreter through a ChatGPT-like interface in your terminal by running `$ interpreter` after installing.
+
+This provides a natural language interface to Python's general-purpose capabilities:
+

+- Run `selenium` to control a Chrome browser.
+- Modify files/folders on your local system.

 ## Features
 
 - Generated code runs locally.
 - Uses `pip` and `apt-get` to extend itself.
 - Interactive, streaming chat inside your terminal.

 Only the last `model_max_tokens` of the conversation are shown to the model, so conversations can be any length, but older messages may be forgotten.

+
+Since generated code is executed in your local environment, it can interact with your files and system settings, potentially leading to unexpected outcomes like data loss or security risks.

+- Watch Open Interpreter like a self-driving car, and be prepared to end the process by closing your terminal.
