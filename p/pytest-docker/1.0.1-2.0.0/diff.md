 Simple [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/) fixtures that help you write integration

 # Installation
-Install `pytest-docker` with `pip` or add it to your test requirements. It is
-recommended to install `docker-compose` python package directly in your
-environment to ensure that it is available during tests. This will prevent

-The default behavior is not to install `docker-compose` with `pytest-docker`. If you

+Install `pytest-docker` with `pip` or add it to your test requirements.

+
+## Docker Compose V1 compatibility
+
+If you want to use the old `docker-compose` command (deprecated since July 2023, not receiving updates since 2021)
+ then you can do it using the [`docker-compose-command`](#docker_compose_command) fixture:
+
+```python
+@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
+def docker_compose_command() -> str:
+    return "docker-compose"
+```
+
+If you want to use the pip-distributed version of `docker-compose` command, you can install it using
 ```
 pip install pytest-docker[docker-compose-v1]
 ```
 
-## Docker Compose v2 compatiblity

-`pytest-docker` will work with Docker Compose v2 out of the box if
-[`compose-switch`](https://github.com/docker/compose-switch)

-The default behavior is not to install `docker-compose` with `pytest-docker`. If you
-want to, you install `pytest-docker` with the `docker-compose-v1`
-extra. You can use the following command:
+Install `pytest-docker` with `pip` or add it to your test requirements.
 
+By default, it uses the `docker compose` command, so it relies on the Compose plugin for Docker (also called Docker Compose V2).

+## Docker Compose V1 compatibility
+
+If you want to use the old `docker-compose` command (deprecated since July 2023, not receiving updates since 2021)
+ then you can do it using the [`docker-compose-command`](#docker_compose_command) fixture:
+
+```python
+@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
+def docker_compose_command() -> str:
+    return "docker-compose"
+```
+
+If you want to use the pip-distributed version of `docker-compose` command, you can install it using
 ```
 pip install pytest-docker[docker-compose-v1]
 ```
 
-## Docker Compose v2 compatiblity

-`pytest-docker` will work with Docker Compose v2 out of the box if

-is installed.

-If you want to use the real Docker Compose v2, it has to be installed

 # Usage
 Here is an example of a test that depends on a HTTP service.
 
 With a `docker-compose.yml` file like this (using the

 Start all services from the docker compose file (`docker-compose up`).
 After test are finished, shutdown all services (`docker-compose down`).
 
 ### `docker_compose_command`
 
 Docker Compose command to use to execute Dockers. Default is to use
-Docker Compose v1 (command is `docker-compose`). If you want to use
-Docker Compose v2, change this fixture to return `docker compose`.

 ### `docker_setup`
 
 Get the docker_compose command to be executed for test spawn actions.
 Override this fixture in your tests if you need to change spawn actions.
 Returning anything that would evaluate to False will skip this command.
